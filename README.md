# Little Esty Shop

## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that required us to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.
This site makes use of a PostgreSQL database seeded by CSV data in order to efficiently store and retrieve data for a hypothetical online commerce platform. The work was split between the four contributors listed below in 9 days.
